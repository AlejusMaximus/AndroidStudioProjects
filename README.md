Android Studio Projects
=======================

It contains my Android learning projects.

Some of them are from coursera.org (Lawrence Angrave - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign): JavaFacts and MovingPixels.

On the other hand, Sensores, Bluev2EDR and BLE are a simple examples build by myself using open source simple examples.

Enjoy! :-)
